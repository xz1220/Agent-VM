Agent VM, or `avm`, is a local manager for AI coding agent configuration. It gives
users a small set of durable objects:

- **Agent**: a reusable agent profile with instructions, skills, MCP servers,
  and runtime configuration.
- **Environment**: an internal default context. Users do not create, switch, or
  manage Environments in the product path.
- **Package**: a distributable bundle that can install agents and their
  referenced capabilities.
- **Runtime**: the target tool where an agent runs, such as Codex,
  Claude Code, OpenCode, Cline, or Cursor.

In daily use, create or install an Agent, then run that Agent. Skills are
configured while creating or editing an Agent; AVM handles runtime detection and
per-run managed config for you.

## Daily Path

```bash
avm create
avm run backend-coder
```

The intended path is simple:

1. Install and initialize AVM.
2. Create an Agent profile with the current preview wizard.
3. Run an Agent.

```text
Blank/default / existing Package
  -> create Agent
    -> run Agent
      -> runtime-specific managed config
        -> Codex / Claude Code / OpenCode / Cline / Cursor
```

## User Modules

### 1. Install, Initialize, And Uninstall

This module owns AVM's lifecycle on the machine.

Current preview:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xz1220/Agent-VM/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
avm init
avm shell init zsh
```

The installer puts `avm` in `$HOME/.local/bin` by default, installs shell
integration into your shell rc file, and initializes `~/.avm` unless
`AVM_SKIP_INIT=1` is set.

Product target:

```bash
avm init
avm doctor
avm uninstall
avm shell install
avm shell uninstall
```

### 2. Agent Configuration

Agent configuration is the primary product surface. An Agent owns its skills,
MCP servers, instructions, and runtime configuration.

Current preview:

```bash
avm create
avm create backend-coder
avm create --from default --name api-coder

avm agent create backend-coder --runtime codex --skills git,test
avm agent clone backend-coder --name backend-reviewer
avm agent edit backend-reviewer
avm agent rename backend-reviewer reviewer --update-refs
avm agent delete reviewer --force
avm agent list
avm agent show backend-coder
avm agent show backend-coder --runtime codex
```

Agent CRUD surface:

```bash
avm agent create
avm agent list
avm agent show <name>
avm agent edit <name>
avm agent delete <name>
avm agent clone <name> --name <new-name>
avm agent rename <old-name> <new-name>
```

`avm create` remains the first-run wizard and shortcut entry. It should create an
Agent from one of these sources:

- a blank/default Agent
- an existing Package created by the user or already installed

When creating or editing an Agent, the skills and MCP picker should show the
current full inventory: AVM-managed capabilities plus user-installed
runtime-global capabilities discovered from supported runtimes.

### 3. Default Environment

Environment management is not a user module in the current product path. AVM
only keeps one internal default Environment.

Users should not create, switch, delete, export, or install Environments. An
Environment does not map runtimes to Agents, because each Agent already owns its
runtime configuration.

Packages do not install, export, or carry Environment metadata.

### 4. Run Agent

This is the daily execution surface.

```bash
avm run backend-coder
avm run backend-coder --runtime codex
```

`avm run` is command-scoped. It does not create a user-managed long-running
state and does not require cleanup.

### 5. Packages

Packages are for distribution and reuse. Users install packages to get Agents
and referenced capabilities; they do not run a package directly.
Packages do not install, export, or carry Environment metadata.

Current preview:

```bash
avm package list
avm package show reviewer
avm package inspect backend-coder.avm.zip
avm export backend-coder --output backend-coder.avm.zip
avm install backend-coder.avm.zip
```

Product target:

```bash
avm package list
avm package show <package>
avm package install <package-or-file>
avm package uninstall <package>
avm package export <agent>
avm package inspect <file.avm.zip>
```

## Runtime Support

AVM renders the selected Agent into runtime-specific managed files.

| Runtime | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | Supported | Native profile/model/reasoning mapping where available |
| Claude Code | Supported | Agent frontmatter and MCP/skills mapping |
| OpenCode | Supported | Config, agent, skills, and MCP mapping |
| Cline | Compatibility | Mostly rendered as rules/MCP settings |
| Cursor | Compatibility | Conservative rules/MCP proof of concept |

Adapters must report each field as `native`, `rendered_as_instructions`,
`ignored`, or `unsupported`. AVM should not pretend every runtime supports the
same feature set.

## Current Preview Gaps

The product surface is not finished.

| Area | Available today | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent | `create`, `list`, `show`, `edit`, `delete`, `rename`, `clone` | richer first-run/package-backed create flow and interactive polish |
| Environment | internal default only | no user-facing Environment module |
| Install lifecycle | installer, `init`, `shell init` | missing first-class doctor/uninstall commands |
| Package | list/show/inspect/export/install | install/export naming still split across commands |
| Skills | `skill list` | should be surfaced primarily inside Agent create/edit |
| Sync | `sync` | should disappear behind `run` |

## Safety Model

AVM is conservative by default:

- installer initialization and `avm init` write under `~/.avm`.
- Agent config should become an explicit CRUD resource, not implicit overwrites.
- Runtime-native files are written only through adapter-declared managed paths.
- Unsupported runtime fields are reported, not silently dropped.
- Secrets should be referenced through environment variables, not exported as
  plaintext profile data.

## Development

```bash
make test
make vet
make fmt
make build
```

The main package is `cmd/avm`. Core packages live under `internal/config`,
`internal/adapter`, `internal/sync`, `internal/runtime`, `internal/state`, and
`internal/packageio`.

## License

No open-source license has been selected yet. Until a license is added, the code
is source-available but not broadly reusable under an open-source license.
